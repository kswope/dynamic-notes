union [array] documentation doesn't work for me, it should be *array.  [arrays], implies an array of arrays

compact removes holes but doesn't specify it explicitly. Its just assumed which I don't like

includes() docs seem insuficient for the examples.  Also it says checks if 'value' but there's no 'value'

take() takes strings but its undocumented

can a generalized ternary function be added to lodash?
