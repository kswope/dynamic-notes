   Promise constructor and resolver

<blockquote>
  When Promise is used as a constructor it requires a callback known as a
  resolver function. The resolver serves two purposes: it receives the resolve
  and reject arguments, which are functions used to update the promise once
  the outcome is known, and any error thrown from the resolver is implicitly
  used to reject the promise.
